# C_Plus_Plus_Dice_Player
Making a cool application for a dice calculator for different types of dices.
For the first version of this code would use one dice at a time.

This is the following required types of files that we might need for the application:
-.cpp
-
-

Required extensions we are using
-Live Share
-C/C++

The following dices would be used:
-1 sided dice (just as a joke for no other choice)
-Coin Flip (or 2 sided dice)
-3 sided dice
-4 sided dice
-5 sided dice
-6 sided dice
-8 sided dice
-10 sided dice
-20 sided dice
-100 sided dice

Would have a basic calculator:
-Buttons from 0-9, +, -, *, /, %, and =.

The color scheme of this can have a blue, grey, and green combo
